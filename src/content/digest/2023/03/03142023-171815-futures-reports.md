<div class="robot-content-container">
The 2023 Design in Tech Report by John Maeda focuses on the intersection of design and artificial intelligence (AI). It explores how designers are evolving to consider people as individuals, rather than just customers or prospects. The report highlights the changing role of design, which now incorporates machine learning, scalability, and profitability. It emphasizes the importance of the "aesthetics of ethics" in design, acknowledging the need to prioritize ethical considerations in the development of AI-powered technologies. Despite this, the report suggests that speaking human fluently will be more crucial than speaking machine language in the near future. The report also introduces the concept of pre-trained foundation models and large language models in AI. Overall, the report aims to demonstrate the business value of this new type of design and suggests that next year's report will focus on this topic.
