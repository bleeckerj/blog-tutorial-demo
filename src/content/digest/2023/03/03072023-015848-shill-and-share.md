In this article, Dr√© Labre explores the concept of design fiction through an analysis of the film "Children of Men". Labre begins by mentioning a recent installation they made on a time machine and their subsequent rewatch of the movie. Labre then invites readers to join them in a discussion of the various artifacts depicted in the film's timeline. Labre suggests that the film serves as an example of design fiction, a practice that uses speculative design to imagine potential futures.

Labre provides readers with some background information on design fiction, highlighting its use in creating narratives and artifacts that prompt critical thinking about the consequences of technology and societal choices. They argue that "Children of Men" effectively utilizes design fiction techniques to create a believable and immersive dystopian world. Labre points to specific objects and design details in the film, such as the protagonist's car and the protagonist's bedroom, to illustrate how design fiction can be employed to shape audience perception and understanding.

Ultimately, Labre's analysis of "Children of Men" serves as a compelling example of the power of design fiction in sparking conversations about the impact of design on society.
