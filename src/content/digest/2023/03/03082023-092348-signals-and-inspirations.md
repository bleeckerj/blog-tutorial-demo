AAAA ChatGPT isn‚Äôt available in China‚Äîit‚Äôs not blocked, but OpenAI, which built the tool, hasn‚Äôt made it available there‚Äîso Guo went onto Taobao, China‚Äôs biggest ecommerce site, where hundreds of thousands of merchants offer everything from iPhone cases to foreign driver‚Äôs licenses.

<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
The black market for access to OpenAI's ChatGPT, a generative AI tool that produces human-like language, is thriving in China. Despite not being officially available in the country, thousands of sellers on popular e-commerce site Taobao offer ChatGPT logins and foreign phone numbers required for verification. On Tencent's WeChat platform, mini programs like "ChatGPT Online" have emerged, where users can ask a few free questions before paying for more time with the chatbot. Copycat versions of ChatGPT have also proliferated. The popularity of the black market highlights the strong demand for generative AI products in China. However, it also underscores the challenges faced by companies in developing such products, given the controlled nature of the Chinese internet and the potential risks associated with the unpredictable output of generative AI. Chinese tech giants like Baidu have been working to catch up with OpenAI and develop their own large language models, such as Baidu's Ernie bot.
