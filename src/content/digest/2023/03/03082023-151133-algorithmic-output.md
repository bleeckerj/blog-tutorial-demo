ChatGPT happened, and suddenly. AI made its way into many aspects of my life. As the hype and concerns keep growing, particularly concerning education as we know it, I have started to perceive how has AI, or generative AI, been used in the classroom.

Want to know how to use AI in the classroom?

<div class="robot-content-container">
In this text, the author discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically ChatGPT, in the classroom. They present four guideposts to help professors and educators effectively engage with AI in education. The first guidepost is to "get your hands dirty," meaning to actively use and experiment with AI rather than just discussing it. The author shares an example of a course where students were required to create a Twitter bot using AI. The second guidepost is to embrace research-creation, which involves using art and making as a research method. The course design shifted from a traditional seminar to a workshop format, allowing students to engage in hands-on AI projects. The third guidepost is to adapt and integrate new AI tools as they become available, such as the use of Stable Diffusion, another generative AI tool, in the class. The fourth guidepost is to critically reflect on the implications and limitations of using AI in education. The author raises concerns about AI's ability to truly understand and think about complex topics, such as the impacts of global warming. Overall, the author encourages educators to actively incorporate AI in the classroom while remaining critical and reflective.
