<div class="robot-content-container">
In this text, titled "Eliza - Anniversary Special 2023," the author explores the implications of generative AI technology and its impact on various industries. The author acknowledges that while generative AI tools have opened up new possibilities and creativity, they also come with unintended consequences that have yet to be fully understood. The author emphasizes that we cannot go back to a world without generative AI, and it is inevitable that AI will continue to evolve and expand its capabilities. As a way of speculating about the future of AI, the author invited 13 designers, engineers, futurists, and researchers to provide their insights. These insights are presented as captions to an Eliza drawing, which serve to critique the present state of technology and prompt discussions about the value of human intelligence and collaboration with AI. Ultimately, these captions provide inspiration for holistic technology strategy, products, and services that consider unintended consequences and bias.
