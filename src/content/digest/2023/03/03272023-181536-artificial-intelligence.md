LLMs, or language models, are the latest groundbreaking innovation in software engineering, comparable to the impact of social, mobile, and cloud technologies, and have the potential to surpass IDEs and Stack Overflow, but unfortunately, many engineers are skeptical and unaware of their significance, just like they were with the early demos of Amazon Web Services and other transformative technologies.

<div class="robot-content-container">
In this blog post, the author discusses the significant impact of LLMs (large language models) on software engineering. They argue that LLMs are not just a major development in the realm of AI, but are on par with revolutionary technologies such as social media, mobile devices, and the World Wide Web itself. Despite this, many engineers are not fully aware of the magnitude of this advancement. The author recounts their own experiences with skepticism towards groundbreaking technologies in the past, such as Amazon Web Services and browser-based messaging. These technologies started as small demos but eventually transformed entire industries. The author suggests that if such monumental advancements were possible with simple starting points, the potential for innovation with LLMs, which possess the capabilities of the Singularity, is enormous. The post ends with a plug for Sourcegraph, a tool that integrates coding and LLMs.
