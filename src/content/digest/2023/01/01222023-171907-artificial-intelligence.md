    "A lot of the perspectives mentioned above and discussed in the last general seminar were also brought up in Ezra Klein show with Ai skeptic Gary Markus, I enjoyed listening to this podcast as it discusses language and intelligence.  Also the idea of truth is complex discussion, factual truth is important and as discussed during the last General Seminar I believe there will probably be Ai fact checkers just as we have for human written text.  (To check on GPTs BS level, obviously GPT 4.0 will probably blow our minds and natural language with factual accuracy will evolve) https //podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447?i=1000592835492"

<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
smartest and most humanlike chatbot to date, which quickly gained popularity on social media. However, amidst the hype, there are skeptics who question the true capabilities and implications of such advancements in AI technology.

Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of psychology and neural science at N.Y.U., is one of the leading voices of AI skepticism. While he is not opposed to AI, Marcus is concerned about the direction of current AI research and the potential for widespread misinformation. He argues that systems like ChatGPT have no mechanisms for fact-checking, which makes them susceptible to generating false information at an unprecedented scale.

In his book "Rebooting A.I.: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust," Marcus offers an alternative approach to AI development. He advocates for a different understanding of intelligence and the development of systems that prioritize trustworthiness.

In this podcast episode, Marcus discusses his critique of current AI systems and provides insights into what it would look like to develop better, more reliable AI technologies. The conversation delves into the challenges and possibilities of AI in today's society.
