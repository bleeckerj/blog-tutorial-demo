<div class="robot-content-container">
In this article, Brian Jackson, research director of Info-Tech Research Group, discusses seven technology scenarios that businesses should be aware of and prepared for in 2023. Jackson emphasizes the importance of scenario planning, which involves considering various possibilities and developing strategies to address them. One scenario involves the potential breakup of Facebook by the metaverse. Jackson agrees with Reuters' Lauren Silva Laughlin that Mark Zuckerberg could split Meta into two companies, one focusing on emerging technologies and the other on the established ad-driven business model of Facebook and Instagram. This move would allow Zuckerberg to continue developing the metaverse without the pressure of quarterly profits from investors. Another scenario involves conflicts between creators and platforms due to the use of generative AI technology, which has led to the creation of impressive content creation tools. Jackson suggests that conflicts may arise as creators demand recognition and compensation for their work, posing a challenge to platforms that rely on user-generated content. The remaining scenarios include increased cybersecurity risks, the integration of artificial intelligence into everyday life, the expansion of remote work opportunities, advancements in quantum computing, and the potential for an economic boom driven by technological innovation. Overall, businesses should consider these scenarios and adapt their strategies accordingly.
