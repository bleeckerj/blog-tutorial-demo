The dream of an artificial mind may never become a reality if AI runs out of quality prose to ingestâ€”and there isnâ€™t much left.

In this article from The Atlantic, the author explores the potential limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) when it comes to reading and understanding human culture. AIs are currently being trained by ingesting vast amounts of text, allowing them to develop impressive abilities such as language translation and writing in different literary styles. However, the supply of quality prose, which is necessary for AI's training, is not limitless. High-quality text, such as books, is essential for training AI, as it produces better writing than text from social media. Researchers predict that AI programs like ChatGPT could run out of high-quality reading material by 2027. Additionally, much of humanity's linguistic creativity from the past is lost forever, leaving only a fraction available for reading. The article suggests that without new text to train on, AI's progress could come to an abrupt halt.
