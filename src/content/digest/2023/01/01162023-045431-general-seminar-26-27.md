In this article, the author discusses the concerns raised by David Krakauer, president of the Santa Fe Institute, about the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Krakauer argues that humans have created two types of cognitive artifacts: complementary and competitive. Complementary cognitive artifacts, such as paper and pen or map and compass, aid our cognitive tasks and help us interact with and understand the world. On the other hand, competitive cognitive artifacts, like AI, directly compete with human cognitive abilities. Krakauer worries that the increasing development of competitive cognitive artifacts may lead to the demise of humanity. 

The author explores Krakauer's argument in detail and critically assesses it. They also highlight the similarities between Krakauer's concerns and those raised by other thinkers such as Nicholas Carr and Evan Selinger. The goal of the article is to shed light on the common misunderstandings surrounding debates about technology and its impact on humanity.

Overall, the article poses important questions about the potential consequences of AI development and the role of cognitive artifacts in shaping human cognition and society.
