<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
Lebanon Fire Company has acquired new technology to combat fires in electric vehicles (EVs). As the number of EVs on the road increases, so does the risk of fire, and these fires are often challenging to extinguish. Lebanon Fire Company is one of the few fire departments in the state, and third on the East Coast, to have the Battery Extinguishing System Technology (BEST), which was purchased using grant money. Traditional methods of extinguishing EV fires, such as using large amounts of water, are costly and time-consuming. However, with the BEST, only one fire truck, a few firefighters, and significantly less water are needed to extinguish the fire. The system works by penetrating the battery pack of the vehicle and flowing 8 to 10 gallons of water per minute into it. This technology, developed by Rosenbauer, a firefighting equipment manufacturer, greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of EV fire response.
