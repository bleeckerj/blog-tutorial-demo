    "I liken it to the scene in Polanskiâ€™s Ninth Gate where the book collector shows Dean Corso the imperfection in 2 of the 3 extant copies in the book. Perhaps somewhere in the future there is a convention just for holders of the first edition, and proof of page 184 is required for entry."
summary: "Imagine a secret society of book nerds gathering at a fantastical convention, where the ultimate badge of honor is possessing the first edition while page 184 serves as the golden ticket for entry - just like that intriguing scene in Polanski's Ninth Gate."
