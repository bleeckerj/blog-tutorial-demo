<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
Cultural fracking, a term coined by Jay Springett, refers to the process of constantly extracting new value from past intellectual property for profit. This phenomenon is prevalent in mass media, as seen through reboots, sequels, and remakes that draw on familiar cultural touchstones. While some argue that cultural fracking allows for individual artistic freedom within big franchises, it is also controversial and concerning for creators outside of a Western cultural hegemony. Treating media as a commodity means that there is a lack of investment in new and alternative stories. This has negative consequences for the cultural landscape and limits opportunities for diverse creators. Similar to the environmental risks associated with fracking oil, cultural fracking can contaminate the cultural "water supply" and wipe out unique ecosystems of storytelling. Additionally, commodified media makes it difficult for creators to reap rewards from their intellectual property. The over-reliance on cultural fracking and the consolidation of companies around existing intellectual property may not provide audiences with the novelty and authenticity they desire. Ultimately, cultural fracking diminishes culture and inhibits creative innovation.
