One of the skills I had to master in high school was sounding intelligent about things I knew nothing about in order to get an A. We can generously call this skill manufactured intelligence.

<p>GPT chat will shake up McKinsey before it has a chance to disrupt Google, but let's be honest, we've all mastered the art of bull$hitting to get ahead in life, whether it's acing high school assignments or convincing wealthy philanthropists to donate money to causes we barely understand.</p>

<div class="robot-content-container">
The author reflects on their experience of "manufactured intelligence" or the ability to sound intelligent about topics they knew nothing about in order to succeed academically. They describe how this skill carried over into their professional life, where they wrote proposals and reports to convince philanthropists and investors. They also discuss their transition from financial analyst to strategist, where they worked with well-known consulting firms like McKinsey and Company and Boston Consulting Group to create lengthy slide decks that illustrated how companies could stay ahead of disruption. Eventually, the author moved into the software industry, where they built prototypes that solved real problems but were often not scalable. Despite this, they were successful in securing funding for disaster relief and accurately predicting market collapses. The author makes the argument that new AI technology, like Chat GPT, will disrupt consulting firms such as McKinsey before it disrupts larger tech companies like Google.
