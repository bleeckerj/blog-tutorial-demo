OG Description: In this paper, we explore the use of metaphors for people working with artificial intelligence, in particular those that support designers in thinking about the creation of AI systems. Metaphors both illuminate and hide, simplifying and connecting to existing knowledge, centring particular ideas, marginalising others, and shaping fields of practice. The practices of machine learning and artificial intelligence draw heavily on metaphors, whether black boxes, or the idea of learn-ing and training, but at the edges of the field, as design engages with computational practices, it is not always apparent which terms are used metaphorically, and which associations can be safely drawn on. In this paper, we look at some of the ways metaphors are deployed around machine learning and ask about where they might lead us astray. We then develop some qualities of useful metaphors, and finally explore a small collection of helpful metaphors and practices that illuminate different aspects of machine learning in a way that can support design thinking.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
In this engaging and thought-provoking paper, the authors delve into the world of metaphors for designers working with AI, examining how these metaphors can both enlighten and mislead us as we navigate the complex realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. From black boxes to the notion of learning and training, the authors explore the various metaphors used in the field and provide insights into their potential pitfalls and benefits, ultimately offering a valuable collection of metaphors and practices that can enhance design thinking in the realm of AI.

<div class="robot-content-container">
This paper explores the use of metaphors for designers working with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Metaphors play a crucial role in understanding and conceptualizing complex ideas, simplifying them and connecting them to existing knowledge. In the context of machine learning and AI, metaphors are commonly used, such as the metaphor of "black boxes" or the concept of "learning and training." However, in the field of design, where computational practices intersect, it is not always clear which terms are used metaphorically and which associations are appropriate. The authors examine the deployment of metaphors in machine learning and AI, considering the potential pitfalls and limitations. They then propose qualities of useful metaphors and provide a collection of metaphors and practices that shed light on different aspects of machine learning, supporting design thinking. By exploring metaphors, designers can gain new insights, expand their understanding of AI systems, and effectively navigate the challenges and complexities of working with AI.
