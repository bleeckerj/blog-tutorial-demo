    "I came across this beautiful exercise done at MIT as a part of "Creative Engineering" course in 1950s. John Arnold, the professor teaching the course, created a book of fictional space exploration memos from "Massachusets Intergalactic Traders" published in 29th century that describe a distant planet called Arcturus IV. Then he had students to design products for the lifeforms / environments described in the memos.  I think you all will enjoy this! It's basically a set of world-building briefs for the designers to engage in making design fiction!  https //stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid rz867bs3905/SC0269_Arcturus_IV.pdf"
summary: "Step into a time machine back to the 1950s, where a genius professor at MIT unleashed his students' creativity by challenging them to design products for a far-off planet, Arcturus IV, using fictional space exploration memos from the future - prepare to have your mind blown!"

I came across this beautiful exercise done at MIT as a part of "Creative Engineering" course in 1950s.

I think you all will enjoy this! It's basically a set of world-building briefs for the designers to engage in making design fiction!
