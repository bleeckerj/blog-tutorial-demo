In a black and white video, Ray Glasser opens his second Betamax, an industrial unit known as the SLO-320, on camera. This video, uploaded on October 26th, 2011, is believed to be the oldest "unboxing" video ever recorded. Glasser explains that he purchased the Betamax specifically for copying tapes from one Betamax to another, as it lacked a built-in TV tuner and timer. The video has been criticized by some who believe it to be staged or fake, but Glasser assures viewers that it is genuine. He points out that he quit smoking in 1985, implying that he does not smoke in the present day, and that much of his hair has since disappeared. Although the audio quality of the video is poor due to a short in the microphone cord, it remains a unique glimpse into the early days of unboxing videos.
