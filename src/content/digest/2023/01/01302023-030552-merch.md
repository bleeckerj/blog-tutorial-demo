The chore coat has a rich history as a piece of workwear designed to withstand physical labor. Originally created in late 19th century France, the chore coat was made from durable fabrics such as cotton drill or moleskin and was favored by laborers, railroad workers, and farmers. It featured a loose fit, large pockets for storing tools and personal items, and button cuffs that made it easy to roll up the sleeves. In France, the coat was known as bleu de travail, or "blue work," due to its vibrant blue color. When the coat reached the United States, it became known as the chore coat and was used for farming and laboring tasks. American workwear companies such as Carhartt began mass-producing chore coats, with Carhartt introducing their iconic duck brown canvas fabric in 1923. Today, the chore coat has evolved into a versatile wardrobe staple and is still produced by many workwear brands.
