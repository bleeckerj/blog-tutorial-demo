<div class="robot-content-container">
The PO-80 record factory is a portable record cutter created in collaboration with Yuri Suzuki. This compact device allows users to engrave and playback 5" discs with ultra-analog lo-fi sound. By simply plugging in any audio device to the 3.5 mm audio input, individuals can create their own vinyl records instantly. The device offers built-in speakers for direct listening or the option to connect an external speaker for a better audio experience. The PO-80 kit includes everything necessary for assembly, from the needle to the disks, allowing users to easily build their own record-cutting machine. To enhance the sound quality of recordings, individuals can use the vinyl mastering tool specifically designed for use with the PO-80. This tool applies the desired equalizer curve to the music, making it easier to achieve good lo-fi sound quality on custom 5" cuts. Additionally, the PO-80 works with the pocket operator family, allowing users to compose a song on any pocket operator and cut it onto their very own vinyl record using the PO-80.
