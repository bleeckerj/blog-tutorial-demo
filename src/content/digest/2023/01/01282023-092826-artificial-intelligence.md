<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
The authors of this paper introduce MusicLM, a model that generates high-quality music from text descriptions. The model is capable of generating music at 24 kHz that remains consistent over several minutes. The researchers conducted experiments that showed MusicLM outperformed previous systems in terms of audio quality and adherence to the text description. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the model can be conditioned on both text and a melody, allowing it to transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption.

To support further research in this area, the researchers publicly released a dataset called MusicCaps, which consists of 5.5k music-text pairs with detailed text descriptions provided by human experts. The paper also discusses the use of MusicLM for generating audio from other types of captions, such as painting descriptions, instrument names, genres, musician experience levels, places, and epochs. Additionally, the researchers tested the diversity of the generated samples while keeping the conditioning and/or semantic tokens constant.

<!-- Summary:  MusicLM is a model generating high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as "a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff" MusicLM outperforms previous systems both in audio quality and adherence to the text description . -->
