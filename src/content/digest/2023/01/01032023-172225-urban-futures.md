<p>The Japanese government is dishing out 1 million yen per child, along with other financial support, to entice families to leave overcrowded Tokyo and breathe life into declining regional areas, but don't think it's a get-rich-quick scheme, as families must commit to living in their new homes for at least five years and contribute to the workforce or start a business.</p>

The Japanese government is dishing out 1 million yen per child, along with other financial support, to entice families to leave overcrowded Tokyo and breathe life into declining regional areas, but don't think it's a get-rich-quick scheme, as families must commit to living in their new homes for at least five years and contribute to the workforce or start a business.

<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
The Japanese government is increasing its efforts to combat population decline in regional areas by offering families 1 million yen ($7,500) per child to leave Tokyo. The new incentive aims to lower the population density in the capital city and encourage people to move to "unfashionable" parts of the country that have been impacted by an aging and shrinking population. The payment, which is a significant increase from the previous relocation fee, will be introduced in April and will be available to families living in Tokyo's core wards, as well as other parts of the metropolitan area and neighboring prefectures. However, families must live in their new homes for at least five years and have at least one working member to be eligible for the cash. The government hopes that the generous sums offered will entice families to revitalize regions and alleviate the pressure on public services in Tokyo. The scheme, which struggled to gain traction when it was first launched three years ago, aims to have 10,000 people relocated from Tokyo to rural areas by 2027.
