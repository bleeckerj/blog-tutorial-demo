In this podcast episode, Ezra Klein interviews Gary Marcus, an AI expert, about the implications of the recent release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. ChatGPT is an AI system that can engage in conversation and generate human-like text based on its training on vast amounts of online data. While the system's ability to produce convincing and coherent responses is impressive, Marcus raises an important question: does ChatGPT truly possess intelligence, or is it simply mimicking human language without understanding its meaning? Marcus argues that these AI systems, while remarkable in their ability to generate content, lack a true understanding of what they are saying or doing. He describes this as "bullshit" in the philosophical sense, content that has no real relationship to the truth. Marcus, who is not against AI but rather has skepticism about our current approach, suggests that relying on systems that lack understanding may not lead to the desired outcomes. This interview provides a critical perspective on the AI revolution and the potential consequences of pushing the boundaries of technology without deeper comprehension.
