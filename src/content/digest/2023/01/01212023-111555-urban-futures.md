d on Archinect and explores the idea that every piece of architecture is first a work of fiction. Ole Scheeren, a renowned German architect and founder of B√ºro Ole Scheeren, emphasizes the power of bringing people, cultures, and practices closer together through his designs. With offices in various cities around the world, including Hong Kong, Beijing, and Berlin, Scheeren's studio works on projects that span across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Despite the diverse typologies and locations of these projects, they all share a common theme: an ability to create emotional anticipation through narratives and stories. The conversation with Scheeren, conducted by Niall Patrick Walsh at the World Architecture Festival in Lisbon, Portugal, touches on topics such as the festival itself, the role of Scheeren's firm, the state of architecture in Asia, and the significance of fiction in the design process. Throughout the discussion, Scheeren highlights the importance of storytelling and imagination in architecture, emphasizing that every successful building tells a compelling story.
