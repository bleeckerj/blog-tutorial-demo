OG Description: Few governments have approved regulations, often because of free-speech concerns. New mandates from China could change the tone of the debate on digital forgeries.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
China's recent adoption of rules governing deepfakes may influence how other governments respond to the growing issue of digital forgeries, but concerns about free speech and the ability to catch and regulate the worst abusers of the technology still remain.

<div class="robot-content-container">
Deepfake technology, which allows for the creation of digital forgeries by swapping faces and voices, has become increasingly accessible and sophisticated in recent years. However, governments worldwide have struggled to regulate its use. China has taken a step forward by implementing new rules that require manipulated content to have the subject's consent and be marked with digital signatures or watermarks. The Chinese government hopes to address the growing concerns surrounding deepfake technology, such as its use in scams and identity theft. However, similar efforts to regulate deepfakes have faced obstacles, as abusers of the technology often operate anonymously and adapt quickly. Additionally, there are concerns about potential infringements on free speech if governments have too much control over deepfakes. Despite these challenges, China's actions could have a ripple effect on other countries' approaches to regulating machine learning and artificial intelligence related to deepfakes. The lack of precedent in this field leaves lawmakers unsure of how to proceed, resulting in varied responses worldwide.
