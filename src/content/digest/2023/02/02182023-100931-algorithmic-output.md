    "Here is single developer doing an adventure game based on MidJourney images (details in the blog)   https //echoesofsomewhere.com/category/devblog/ It points toward a future where 2D images (sketches/ai-art) can be transformed into editable 3d assets with much lower friction. Algoritms that extract forms, textures and lighting separately for 3d assets. Together with direct 3d generation from prompts this may lead to a combination of story board & concept art that is directly editable – animate, restyle, change composition, or refine further directly for production."
summary: "Prepare to be amazed as a single developer embarks on an extraordinary adventure game, utilizing mind-blowing technology that can seamlessly transform 2D images into editable 3D assets, revolutionizing the way we create and bring storyboards and concept art to life."
