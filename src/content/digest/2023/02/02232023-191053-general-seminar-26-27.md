OG Description: While the deluge has become a nuisance, the stories are easy to spot. The writing is “bad in spectacular ways,” one editor said.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
In a battle reminiscent of a science fiction novel, science fiction magazines are being inundated with chatbot-generated stories that are "bad in spectacular ways," causing editors to halt submissions and wonder if AI will ultimately overthrow human authors.

<div class="robot-content-container">
In the world of science fiction magazines, editors are battling against a flood of stories generated by A.I. chatbots. Three prominent science fiction magazines – Clarkesworld, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and Asimov’s Science Fiction – have recently experienced a surge in submissions that have been created by A.I. bots. This influx has become overwhelming for the editors, leading some to temporarily halt open submissions. Neil Clarke, the editor of Clarkesworld, stated that they typically receive around 1,100 submissions per month, but in just a few weeks, they received 700 legitimate submissions and 500 machine-written submissions. Although Clarke did not disclose how he identified the chatbot-generated stories, he noted that they had certain identifiable "traits" and were "bad in spectacular ways." While there are concerns that A.I. chatbots could eventually disrupt the literary world and replace human writers, for now, the distinction between human-crafted science fiction and bot-generated spam is still quite clear.
