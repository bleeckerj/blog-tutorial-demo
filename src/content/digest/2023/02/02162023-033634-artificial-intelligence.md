<div class="robot-content-container">
In computer science classes at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx, students are not only learning programming but also critiquing chatbots. Instead of simply focusing on coding, educators are encouraging students to think critically about the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. One teacher, Marisa Shuman, used an algorithm-generated lesson plan created by a chatbot called ChatGPT to evaluate its effectiveness with her students. The goal is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in "critical computing" by teaching them how to critique computer algorithms. This approach is being implemented in various school districts across the United States, including New York City Public Schools, which is training computer science teachers to help students identify AI biases and potential risks. The aim is to foster an understanding of the ethical implications of AI tools and to challenge problematic technologies. By engaging students in this way, educators hope to prepare them for the evolving landscape of AI.
