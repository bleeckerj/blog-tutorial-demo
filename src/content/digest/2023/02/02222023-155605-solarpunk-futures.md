AAAA Hello everyone üëã just wrote an article on thee need to think in terms of a crisis of the sensible rather than an ecological crisis. I  wrote my thesis on the need to reconfigure our relationships with our natural environment. I propose practical tools and caring practices aiming at co-creating with non-humans in public institutions.

<p>In a world filled with climate change science and reports, we've lost touch with the natural world, failing to cultivate meaningful relationships with non-human beings, and it's time to shift our perceptions and reconnect before it's too late.</p>

<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
In this article, the author discusses the need to shift our relationships with the natural world in order to address the ecological crisis. They argue that while climate change science has provided ample evidence of the crisis we face, what is really needed is a change in perception. The author suggests that our current lack of connection with the natural world has led to an impoverishment of our ability to feel, perceive, and understand the relationships we can develop with living things. Children, for example, are growing up disconnected from nature, unable to identify even basic plants from their own surroundings. The author's research journey began with the idea that we are all interconnected and capable of communicating with other species. They explore the concept of interdependence between humans and the natural environment, which challenges the exploitative relationship that Western nations have had with nature. The author calls for a shift towards relational thinking, which is central to indigenous philosophies that recognize the interconnectedness of all forms of life.
