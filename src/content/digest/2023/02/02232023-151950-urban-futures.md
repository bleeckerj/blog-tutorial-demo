<div class="robot-content-container">
The University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning is at the forefront of using artificial intelligence (AI) in architecture. Matias del Campo, director of the Architecture and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, emphasizes that AI is going to revolutionize architecture and it is crucial for architects to engage with it to have control over the future of the field. Del Campo also highlights the importance of architects contributing to the early stages of AI development to ensure long-term and reliable use in the field. This includes addressing biases in datasets and making sure they reflect architectural excellence and diversity. U-M's Taubman College has established the Architecture and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AR2IL) to improve the application of AI in architecture research. The lab adopts an interdisciplinary approach and collaborates with experts from various fields to discuss the paradigm shift in architecture brought about by AI.
