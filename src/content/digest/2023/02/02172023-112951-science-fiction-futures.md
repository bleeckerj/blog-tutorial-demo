In this video, Joel Blackledge explores how science fiction films portray the future of food. He discusses the various tropes and themes present in these films, ranging from unimaginable abundance to the homogenous consumption and joylessness depicted in George Lucas's THX1138. Blackledge highlights the role that food plays in shaping our understanding of futuristic societies in these films. He also examines how science fiction utilizes food as a tool to critique and comment on contemporary food systems and societal norms. Through his analysis, Blackledge offers insights into the ways in which these films imagine and speculate about the future of food, and the implications they have for our own relationship with food in the present day. This video provides an engaging exploration of the intersection between science fiction, food, and societal visions in popular culture.
