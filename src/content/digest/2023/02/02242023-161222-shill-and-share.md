<div class="robot-content-container">
Nathaniel Stern is an interdisciplinary artist who explores the connection between human feeling, nature, and technology. In an interview with Ola Kalejaye, Stern discusses his work and the concept of "The World After Us," using art to ensure a positive future. From a young age, Stern expressed an interest in various creative media, studying fashion design in university before stumbling upon New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). This program sparked his passion for interactive art and the exploration of performativity, particularly the relationship between speech and the body. Stern's work focuses on affect, the body's response to the environment without a specific name or qualification. One of his early projects involved creating custom imaging rigs to capture landscapes and movement. Stern also discusses the impact of blockchain technology on his art, allowing him to live in both the physical and digital worlds simultaneously. Overall, Stern's work seeks to create a cyber-natural future that integrates technology and humanity.
