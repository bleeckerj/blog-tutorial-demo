    "Hocam, entry level Wombler receipt scanner, purchased along with two pamphlets on the 'reality' of our simulated democracy as well as general supplies required for traversing the wildfire smoke-filled, partially desertificationified Mountain View, CA. Wombling is a method those outside of the official time banks still use to acquire fractional portions of digital currency. By scanning receipts found in large shopping areas frequented by the 'Have's' and uploading it to the Hocam website, data is collected in the only reliable way possible in a near future where all personal data has been shielded from advertising companies and merchandisers."
summary: "In Mountain View, CA, I got my hands on an entry level Wombler receipt scanner, a couple of eye-opening pamphlets about our so-called democracy, and some survival gear for navigating through the smoke-filled, partially desertified streets - all because I wanted to join the rebellious, yet ingenious, method of Wombling to collect digital currency by scanning receipts from the elites and sticking it to those sneaky advertisers and merchandisers in a world where personal data is fiercely protected."
