"Fieldnotes from the Metaverse" is an ongoing web series that serves as a precursor to an upcoming book. The series explores the history, visions, perspectives, and narratives of the Metaverse, focusing on specific milestones and their impact on shaping the discussion around this concept. The author, Dirk Songuer, delves into influential works like "Neuromancer" and "Snow Crash," which were the first to introduce the terms "Cyberspace" and "Metaverse" in the 1980s and early 1990s. The series also examines the advent of multiplayer virtual worlds with the creation of the first MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) in 1978, the social dynamics within virtual worlds in the 1990s, and the question of players' rights in the early 2000s. Additionally, the series highlights key events such as the emergence of virtual economies and real-money trading in online games.
