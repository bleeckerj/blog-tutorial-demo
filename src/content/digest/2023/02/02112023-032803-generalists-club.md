Design thinking, a problem-solving approach that emphasizes collaboration and creativity, was once hailed as a tool that could revolutionize the world. However, its implementation may have fallen short of its promises. This article explores the potential pitfalls of design thinking and how it may have inadvertently hindered progress rather than advancing it. The author recounts their experience at IDEO.org, a social-impact spinoff of a design consulting firm, where design thinking was central to their work. While the methodology appeared inclusive and egalitarian on the surface, the author observed that it often failed to consider the perspectives and expertise of those directly impacted by the problems being addressed. Design thinking's rise in popularity during the Obama era saw it being embraced by various sectors, from healthcare and government agencies to big tech companies. However, the article suggests that its widespread adoption may have been driven more by profit and hype than genuine transformative impact. Ultimately, the implementation of design thinking may have fallen short of its original intent due to a lack of contextualization and a disconnect from reality.
