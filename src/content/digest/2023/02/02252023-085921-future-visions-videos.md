AAAA Year 2050. Adamo was born, the last child in Italy.
An already rare event, which arrived after months without new births, but destined never to happen again.
Three years later, the maternity wards of hospitals, kindergartens and nursery schools are now empty, abandoned.
Adam's parents are divided between happiness and joy in sharing their life with the little one and concern for the future that awaits him. On the other hand, what kind of childhood can a child destined to grow up without playmates or classmates have? And what future can a country without children have?

How did we get here?
How could we have underestimated the demographic crisis for decades and not implemented concrete measures to support new parents?

This is a story that belongs to the future, but which speaks of our present. A future that sociologists and demographers have predicted, but that today, if the country system, companies and institutions decide to act, we can change.

The video titled "Adamo 2050 | Una storia vera dal futuro - Un film di Plasmon" tells the story of Adamo, the last child born in Italy in the year 2050. The video depicts a future where there have been months without any new births, resulting in maternity wards, nurseries, and kindergarten schools being abandoned and empty. Adamo's parents experience a mix of happiness and worry for his future, as he grows up without companions to play with or classmates to learn alongside. The video raises questions about how society reached this point and how the demographic crisis has been underestimated for decades. It emphasizes the need for concrete measures to support new parents, urging organizations, institutions, and businesses to take action. The video suggests that if collective efforts are made, it is possible to change this future and ensure a different outcome.
