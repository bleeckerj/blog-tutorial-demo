OG Description: Living Carbon is ready to begin planting thousands of GMO trees engineered to pull 27% more carbon from the air.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
A biotech startup is taking on climate change by planting genetically engineered trees that can capture more carbon from the air, with their first batch of "supertrees" set to be planted in February 2023.

<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
A biotech startup called Living Carbon has developed genetically modified trees that are designed to be more efficient at capturing carbon from the air. Trees are natural carbon sinks, but the process can be slow, with larger trees able to store more carbon over time. Living Carbon has genetically engineered hybrid poplar trees, inserting genes from squash and green algae, to enhance their ability to photosynthesize and capture carbon. In a controlled environment trial, these modified trees grew 53% faster and captured about 27% more carbon than unmodified trees. Living Carbon plans to plant 4 million of these GMO trees in 2023, starting with 60,000 seedlings in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The hope is that these "supertrees" will provide an effective way to combat climate change by sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.
