    "https //openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/ As our systems get closer to AGI, we are becoming increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of our models. Our decisions will require much more caution than society usually applies to new technologies, and more caution than many users would like. Some people in the AI field think the risks of AGI (and successor systems) are fictitious; we would be delighted if they turn out to be right, but we are going to operate as if these risks are existential."
summary: "OpenAI is getting serious about AGI and wants to avoid any catastrophic outcomes, even if some experts think the worries are overblown - better safe than sorry!"

OG Description: Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligenceâ€”AI systems that are generally smarter than humansâ€”benefits all ofÂ humanity.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
AI systems that are generally smarter than humans, known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), have the potential to benefit humanity in numerous ways, but also come with serious risks, and it is crucial for society and developers to figure out how to navigate them, ensuring that AGI empowers humanity, is widely shared, and minimizes risks; in order to prepare for AGI, deployment and experience with progressively more powerful AI systems in the real world is important, as it allows for a gradual transition that gives time to understand, adapt, regulate, and co-evolve, while navigating challenges through rapid learning and careful iteration.

<div class="robot-content-container">
In this blog post, the authors discuss the importance of planning for the development and deployment of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and beyond. AGI refers to AI systems that are generally smarter than humans. The authors argue that if AGI is successfully created, it has the potential to greatly benefit humanity by increasing abundance, boosting the global economy, and advancing scientific knowledge. However, they also acknowledge that AGI comes with risks, such as misuse and societal disruption. Despite these risks, the authors believe that it is not possible or desirable to halt the development of AGI forever. Instead, they emphasize the need for society and developers to figure out how to get it right. The authors outline several principles that they consider important, including empowering humanity, ensuring fair access and governance, and successfully navigating risks. They also emphasize the importance of deploying and gaining experience with increasingly powerful AI systems in order to gradually transition to a world with AGI. The authors advocate for a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration to address the challenges associated with AI deployment. They conclude by stating their belief that increased usage of AI in the world will lead to positive outcomes and express their commitment to promoting it.
