<div class="robot-content-container">
The article "MUDs to Metaverse: The Unreal Estate Deal" discusses the concept of virtual real estate in the metaverse. The author reflects on their experiences in the 3D virtual world Active Worlds and critiques how the concept of "The Metaverse" replicates negative aspects of colonial expansion and manifest destiny. They also explore the history of virtual goods and the origins of virtual real estate in text-based virtual worlds called MUDs. These MUDs, which ran on mainframe computers, allowed users to create and explore virtual worlds through text commands. The article raises questions about why virtual real estate was being sold in 1995 and whether it is due to the influence of western property rights or other factors. The author notes the similarities between the ability to create in text-based virtual worlds and the AI interfaces of today. Overall, the article challenges the idea of metaverse real estate and raises the question of its true purpose and significance.
