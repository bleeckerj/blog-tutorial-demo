OG Description: An exploration of two decades of American life under the Department of Homeland Security.  <!-- Example: Display each item in a paragraph -->
From The Verge comes "Homeland," a special series delving into the 20-year mess that is the Department of Homeland Security, showing how it has grown into a bloated bureaucracy with shifting priorities and a budget that has tripled since its inception, all in the name of protecting the "homeland" from an ambiguously defined enemy.

<div class="robot-content-container">
The text discusses the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and explores its role in American life over the past two decades. It highlights the ambiguity and broad definition of the "terrorist threat" that justified the creation of the DHS, which could be interpreted as a way to cast foreigners and dissenting voices as threats to national security. The DHS, as an umbrella agency overseeing multiple departments, has become one of the largest agencies in the federal government, employing over a quarter-million people and receiving a significantly increased budget. The text suggests that while the US enforces its power abroad through military might, domestically, it employs a more covert form of violence through bureaucracy. The DHS's shifting priorities reflect changing notions of threats to the "homeland," from real issues like climate change and the pandemic to imagined threats such as activists and voter fraud. Overall, the text offers a critical examination of the DHS and its impact on American society.
