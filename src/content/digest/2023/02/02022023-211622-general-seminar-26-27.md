The website B.A.S.A.A.P. is about being as smart as a puppy and avoiding the 'uncanny valley' by making smart things that don't try to be too smart and fail, like puppies making endearing failures in their attempts to learn and improve.

<div class="robot-content-container">
The text is a blog post from the now-archived website of design company BERG. The author, Matt Jones, introduces the concept of B.A.S.A.A.P. (Be As Smart As A Puppy), which he has been thinking about since 2002. B.A.S.A.A.P. encompasses ideas related to proactive personalization and interaction, as well as machine learning and consumer-grade artificial intelligence. Jones discusses how machine learning has become increasingly popular due to the availability of data and processing power. He mentions examples such as Hunch and Google Priority Inbox, which demonstrate the utility of such approaches. Jones also mentions the advancement of robotics technology, illustrated by a household robot called ApriPoco by Toshiba, which can learn and respond to user commands through face and speech recognition. Overall, the blog post explores the concept of creating smart devices that are endearing and avoid the pitfalls of trying to appear too intelligent.
