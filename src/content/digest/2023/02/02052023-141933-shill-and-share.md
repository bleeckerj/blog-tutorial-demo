    "Just wanted to share out that we're launching this ebook this week and to thank those of you who took a look at an earlier draft and shared some feedback.

Oh, and brace yourself for the laugh, my graphic designer wife and I had to shell out a lifetime membership to MidJourney... it's worth it, though! ðŸ˜‚"
