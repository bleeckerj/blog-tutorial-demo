<div class="robot-content-container">
The huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers repository on GitHub is a Swift application that demonstrates Core ML Stable Diffusion. Core ML is a framework provided by Apple that allows developers to integrate machine learning models into their iOS applications. The Swift app in this repository showcases the functionality of Core ML Stable Diffusion, which is an algorithm for inferring the stable value of the inputs to a neural network. The app utilizes the Core ML framework to load and utilize a trained neural network model, and then uses the Stable Diffusion algorithm to infer the stable values of the inputs. The repository includes the source code for the Swift application, as well as documentation and examples to help developers understand and use Core ML Stable Diffusion in their own projects. The app is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.
