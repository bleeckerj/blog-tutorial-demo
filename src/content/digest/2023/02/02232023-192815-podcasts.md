<div class="metadata-title-header pt-3 pb-3 pl-2">GPT Summary</div>
<div class="robot-content-container">
In this podcast episode, author and tech company's social impact chief Deji Bryce Olukotun discusses the importance of imagining a better future and using speculative fiction to guide policy solutions. Olukotun rejects the idea that the rich and powerful should dictate technology's future and instead emphasizes the need for diverse perspectives and voices. He believes that speculative fiction can depict open societies where everyone benefits from technology's economic advancements and where competition and innovation thrive. By exercising the right to imagine our own future, Olukotun argues that we can challenge the dominant narratives put forth by profit-driven corporate figures and take action to create a more equitable and inclusive technological landscape. Olukotun also explores the influence of previous presidencies and Silicon Valley's expansion on his work, the value of envisioning a "post-scarcity" world, and the importance of stakeholder-based activism in addressing critical issues.
