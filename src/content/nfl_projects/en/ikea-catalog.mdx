description: We were commissioned to workshop and introduce Design Fiction as a research methodology by IKEA and Stockholm University's Mobile Life Centre. We worked with researchers in a practical hands-on workshop to make sense of the trends of the day (2015), their research areas, and possible evolutions of home life, consumer trends and needs, and related topics in the categories of domestic life, food, urban life, travel, leisure, and entertainment. We developed and refined concepts through a focussed two-day workshop. We took these concepts, continued to evolve them and finally represent them in the form of a product catalog we 'brought back' from IKEA's near future.
summary: What might domestic home life look like in some possible near future if our evidence of this was in the form of the iconic IKEA product catalog?
