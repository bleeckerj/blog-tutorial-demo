description: "A Newspaper created for The Museum of Football in Manchester, UK to celebrate the museum's opening and to represent the way Big Data, Algorithms, Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Betting might shape the future of sports."
summary: "We went to the future of sports...and brought back a newspaper. Winning Formula touches on more easily seen aspects of performance analytics, and new ways to depict and consume football in media. It also explores future possibilities hiding just below the surface, possible phenomena such as data manipulation as a kind of doping, the impacts of high-frequency sport betting, or politics related to data-based services like media, measurement and reporting."

## The Question(s)

<em>Question:</em> How will the so-called beautiful game of global football be different in a world where sport itself, and the culture of the fans who love it, is altered by the rush of data, quantification, analytics and digital delivery? 

<em>Question:</em> What might a high-stakes match of the near future be like when every move is measured, and every tactic forecast by silicon? 

<em>Question:</em> What will the technologically savvy supporter and the lifelong fan alike experience differently when Big Data takes on the game?

## The Brief

Consider these questions. 

Now, travel into these futures. 

Have a look around. 

Find a newspaper. 

Grab the sports section. 

Now come back to the present.

Now, create the newspaper that will help us appreciate and see the implications of these trends and possibilities in sports.

## The Process
We approached this project by exploring the emerging cultural and technological trends. Then we had ideation sessions and workshops while observing the kinds of stories that appear in a traditional sports newspaper. Subsequent to this we developed parallel stories — from reportage of events, personalities, scandals, matches and so on — that made an issue of the newspaper seem whole, and familiar.

We worked to create the vividness and character of a newspaper through visual design using excessive typography to make the newspaper "shout" with enthusiasm and love for sport. We created drama, intrigue and conflict — 'Men vs. The Machine' is the lead headline, and presented a journalistic view of the possibilities implied. We also included advertisements and other elements that help build the full range of this world's culture and entertainment.

We pulled some assets for ads from previous projects, creating a curious larger world between projects and clients. Finally, the mechanical design and flatplan was performed in a typical 3 column newspaper layout, and the document was made print ready in time for the museum's opening. We also managed to have Winning Formula included int he evening edition of the local Manchester newspaper.
