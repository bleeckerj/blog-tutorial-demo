Hello^2

1. It gets asked often. Probably one way or another in every call I find myself on.
2. <em>"Why Design Fiction?"</em>
3. I'll put it simply and high-mindedly. Then I'll ground the _Why?_ in the everyday familiar.
    <div class="mt-4"></div>

    <span class="mt-4 text-xl">_Design Fiction is Imagination made Tangible and Familiar._</span>
    <div class="mt-4"></div>

    _**It provides the ground upon which Imagination can be both expansive, and pragmatic.**_ 
        <div class="mt-4"></div>

    _**Design Fiction makes possibility feel palpable, tangible, familiar, concrete<sup>*</sup>, and grounded. Imagination can  unlocks the Imagination that lies within your organization, your team, yourself.**_ 

    And sensing possibility, feeling into what could be, and the 'not yet true' are the seeds of the mythopoesis that builds entire worlds.

5. And Unlocking Imagination is Advantage.

6. Imagination is the Engine of Innovation, Change, and Creation.

7. So what does this have to do with Design Fiction?

8. I didn't know until after The Manual of Design Fiction was out in the world that the undergirding principle was that Design Fiction helps us see into _grounded_ futures, and that much futures work has always been either abstract or quite high level. 

9. If you're trying to make sense of what could be in order to shape your strategy and clarify your decision making, an abstraction of a possible future ends up unmoored from the structure required _for_ decision making.

10. Design Fiction grounds the abstract future and situates it _in the particular_. 

11. What does this mean, _"in the particular"?_ 

12. That is the grounding of a possible future into relatable, concrete artifacts _from_ that future.

13. Instead of asking oneself, "What is an AI future?", we _start_ by grounding the proposition. We might ask ourselves, "What is it to wake up in a future in which AI isn't a confusing sea of conflict, confusion, and fear?"

14. To do a thorough job of sense-making of that which at the moment makes _no sense_, we must approach this non-sense by assuming, when it is now integrated into the world, it can only integrate if it has come to a point where it does now in point of fact make sense.

15. That is, we assume the possibility has gone from 'not *yet true' to a matter-of-fact; possibility has gone from nonsense to that which makes sense, and is quite sensible to the point of familiar or even nothing to be of any concern, any more than we concern ourselves with any of life's mundane features, like remotely controlling a television by yelling phrases at it. That is, until we _do_ concern ourselves with such curious new interaction rituals in the moments they fail us, or themselves become confused.

16. Grounded futuring. That's another way to think of Design Fiction.

as so many previous innovations that once were scoffed at, or met with confusion, or conflict, or skepticism.




16. We should make no assumptions in any case about what will or will not make sense in some possible near future world.





17. Nor should we assume that there is any methodology or futures mechanism that can predict what near future worlds we will inherit.




15. possibility has become If the That is to say, pretty buy too artistic or poetic, or too 'high level' to help us decide 'what to do on Monday'<sup>*</sup>.

9. Design Fiction splits the difference by bringing in a productive way by taking all the same inputs that might lead to art futures or macro futures, and shows you what it might be to wake up on some future Monday.

10. This is the grounding function of Design Fiction.

7. These days it feels as though our connection to Imagination is tenuous in the best of cases. We don't prize Imagination in the same way we treasure our ability to build systems that make sense within already defined epistemologies.

8. By that I mean we don't _teach_ Imagination. There is no _Advanced Placement_ course in Imagination in high school. You can't get a degree in Imagination.

9. The implication is that
