Matt Webb has never not been prototyping publicly. Looking for proof? Pics or it didn't happen?

Back in 2008, Boris Anthony and some others made space for a bunch of us to come together, on our own dime, to Montreal to spend a few days together in a wonderful spirit of generosity, shared curiosity, and a desire to interact and amplify the conversations that were happening around the middle-era of the web, before it was consumed by the mechanisms of value extraction.

It was called [Design Engaged]().

We need more things like Design Engaged. It's happening, but we need more coordination and collaboration and these kinds of things like Randy Plemel does — simple things that zealously sharing the work of others, amplifying the sensibility and spirit of a particular kind of creativity that recognizes that beautiful, unexpected evolutions happen when we do not operate like the world is a zero-sum game.

I'll never forget sharing hasty, skampy, generally rough slides that were my early meandering thoughts on science-fact / science-fiction that would become the scaffolding for Design Fiction.

The highlight was having someone who I revered and admired — Timo Arnall — come up to me and say with a kind of sincerity I'll never forget, and a smile that conveyed earnest admiration: "That's really good stuff."

Although the memories of these few days are profound (a number of us sat in someone's apartment and watched the Obama debate just a month before the 2008 election), it does make me a bit sad that many of us have not found the way to stay tightly integrated in our efforts to think and do audaciously, and to explore and investigate together the potential for that this kind of creative consciousness. (Matt? Do you get my emails?)

More of this.

Thanks Randy Plemel for putting that together! See you in the Discord.
