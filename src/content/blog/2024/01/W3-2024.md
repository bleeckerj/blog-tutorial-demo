I think I'm running behind in these already. Partially because I was deep down a rabbit hole putting this rig together to be able to get back to doing things like Weeknotes and similar dispatches..

1. I went on a short/long trip to Arizona State University which has the wonderful Center for Science and the Imagination to help participate in and facilitate a workshop exploring Metaverse Futures. The workshop was engaging, well-coreographed, and I believe I have an email in my inbox asking for something. It's perpetually hard to stay engaged after participatingi n a workshop where you're immersed and focused for two days, then come back to the studio with a pile of things to tend to and other fun things to do. There's a workshop model where that doesn't happen; where the work is completed in the workshop and the synthesis happens by the organizers and/or a 2nd party. That's not a complaint by any means. More a reflection on what could be and thoughts on ways of facilitating work.

2. üê± Fiona Raby will be a mentor in the Forecast Mentorships' program for the 2024-25 edition over at [@forecast_platform](https://instagram.com/forecast_platform). She's looking for design practitioners to work on a funded project, which includes an artists' fee and production budget. [Here's some information and application stuff!](https://forecast-platform.com/guidelines) Apply! And here's more about Fiona's focus ‚Äî¬†['Paradoxical Imaginings: Objects and Ideas'](https://forecast-platform.com/mentor/fiona-raby)

3. üèñÔ∏è Had a conversation with a National Tourism Board ‚Äî one of those agencies that manages and promotes tourism within a state ‚Äî as they evidently do 'foresight' and were curious as to how to decant their foresight work into experiential stuff. This reminded me of _Project Wanderful_ where one of the most exciting and not-executed artifacts on the table was a City Guide. What an awesome conceit to represent the future of anywhere in the form of, say, one of those Wallpaper City Guides, or a Monocle City Guide. Oh, crap. I still owe them a reply. Must do that.

4. üññüèΩ Met up with [Ruth Guerra](https://instagram.com/ridguerra) on the phone/zoom and did a causual minisode emerging practioner-type podcast conversation. So, more material to edit. (( Needs producer/collaborator )). I stumbled across Ruth's IG Story where she wondered about that film-based-on-the-book ['Leave the World Behind'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12747748/). I had just seen it. It stuck and sat with me. And I watched it again while on a plane. Likes: the set-piece vibe. Not a lot of background talen. Just principals with conflict betwix. Felt like it could be a stage play. Haven't read the book. Probably won't.

5. üò≥ Here's something: "What do you do, how did you end up doing it, and how do you make money?" - the question asked multiple times while at CSI @ ASU. The answer evades. Could be a good topic for a short minisode.

6. ü•© I have to remind myself routinely that, when seen from the outside, it's not entirely obvious what I do here and how organizations and teams can 'engage' with Near Future Laboratory. It's a totally fair point. It might seem like walking in to a restaurant from an alien culture ‚Äî and there's no menu. The waiter just sort of looks at you and shrugs and asks, 'Well..? What are you waiting for?' And you just stare blankly back without a clue as to what to ask for, how to ask for it, what it might cost, and if it's something you're prepared to eat. So ‚Äî working on that.

7. üîå From <em>Engineering Dept.</em>, I've been looking at some kind of facility for converting the output of this here 3rd Evolution Near Future Laboratory Blog easily into emails that I can simply shove in to my existing enterprise email solution.

FWIW, I've looked at these Nodejs utilities:

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css)

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-inline)

But had difficulty getting them up and running, but I didn't try very hard.

I also looked at juice [https://github.com/Automattic/juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice) which also seems promising, but that'd be a project and I also tried enough to put it into the 'promising..check back' category.

This [https://github.com/remy/inliner](https://github.com/remy/inliner) seems ancient but might work?

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?

<em>Update!</em> I got it working, mostly using inliner, the ancient one. I had to refactor to straight wonky Nodejs because I kept getting language complaints from Typescript. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
