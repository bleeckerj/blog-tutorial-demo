1. A short/long trip to Arizona State University which has the wonderful Center for Science and the Imagination to help participate in and facilitate a workshop exploring Metaverse Futures.

2. Had a conversation with a National Tourism Board — one of those agencies that manages and promotes tourism within a state — as they evidently do 'foresight' and were curious as to how to decant their foresight work into experiential stuff. This reminded me of _Project Wanderful_ where one of the most exciting and not-executed artifacts on the table was a City Guide. What an awesome conceit to represent the future of anywhere in the form of, say, one of those Wallpaper City Guides, or a Monocle City Guide.

3. Met up with Ruth Guerra on the phone/zoom.

4. "What do I do and how did I end up doing it?" - the question asked multiple times while at CSI @ ASU

5.
