title: "The World Builds While You Build It"

description: Never sure I have every felt comfortable with 'world building' as it evokes a top-down image of the world — the god's eye view of the world. I prefer the value of the partial perspective rather than the totalizing gaze from above. I want to be within a world and make sense of it 'on the ground' — a grounded perspective. Finding clues and sense-making on the go. This is a value of Design Fiction. With Design Fiction we see clues about the world but not all of it. Why is that?
