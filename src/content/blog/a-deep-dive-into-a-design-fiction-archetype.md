Let's pause for a brief announcement from our station manager, which is this: this Wed April 19th I will be hosting a [Design Fiction Debrief](https://ti.to/near-future-laboratory/design-fiction-debrief-magazine-from-the-future) — a deep-dive, teardown, after-action report, project assessment, if you will. 
This is a seminar-like session, with an opportunity to AMA, where I will describe in detail an actual, real-world Design Fiction project. We will dive into the depths of how the Near Future Laboratory does Design Fiction. (Remember, we literally [wrote the book on Design Fiction](http://themanual.nearfuturelaboratory.com/) and it's literally called 'The Manual of Design Fiction' so..there..)
 
In this Design Fiction Debrief, we'll go behind-the-scenes to see how we created an immersive futures context of a world of autonomous vehicles and how we used one of the most effective Design Fiction Archetypes — a Magazine from the Future.
